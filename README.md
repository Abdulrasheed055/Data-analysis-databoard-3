 ## ðŸ“ˆ Recommendations:
Conservative Price Increase:
- To avoid hitting a price ceiling and risking a drop in demand, a cautious increase of 10â€“15% is suggested:
- New price range: $5.49â€“$5.74 (from $4.99 in 2022).
- This approach allows us to gauge the market reaction without jeopardizing customer retention.

Market Analysis:
-Conduct additional research to assess customer satisfaction
-competitive dynamics, and economic factors. This ensures that pricing decisions align with market expectations.

 Segmented Pricing Strategy:
-Differentiate pricing for casual and registered users
- capitalizing on their unique price sensitivities to maximize revenue potential.

Monitor & Adjust:
- Roll out new prices while closely monitoring customer feedback and sales data. This agile approach minimizes risk and ensures continuous optimization.
